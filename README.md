<h1>Montro</h1>
<p style="text-indent:30px;">A quick [no longer in development] project by Moin Nadeem, to aid and facilitate in student's daily lives. Currently, all that is present is Math, but the idea can be expanded to any subject. For example: Part of speech, definition, etc definers could be written to aid in Language Arts. Notes creator for Science, so on and so forth. However, this does have a basic Math JS library for use.</p>
