<p style="text-indent:30px;">Hey guys. This is what I've been working on for the past couple of weeks. I wanted to show it to you. This site will be for <b>aid</b> in math, and is meant to check your answers to make sure that you've been doing your work correctly. Don't become too reliant on this, it'll screw you up badly. I'll shut up and let you check the site up now. Enjoy! (Note: the only page up right now is the <a href="pointscalc.html">Points Calculator.</a></p>
